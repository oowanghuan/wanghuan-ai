        <p>Hey friends,</p>

        <p>Lately, the most common questions I've been getting are:</p>

        <div class="question-list">
          <div class="question-item">"How advanced is AI right now?"</div>
          <div class="question-item">"Can I actually use it in my work?"</div>
          <div class="question-item">"Honestly, will I get replaced someday?"</div>
        </div>

        <p>Today, I won't talk about technical details, model parameters, or try to create anxiety.<br />Let's just chat like friends. I want to clarify one thing:</p>

        <blockquote class="highlight-quote">
          <strong>How should AI actually be used in real life and real work?</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <hr />

        <h2>1. Demystifying AI: What Is It Really?</h2>

        <p>Let's shatter the myth first.</p>

        <p>The AI tools we use now (ChatGPT, Kimi, DeepSeek, Claude, etc.)<br /><strong>are not conscious brains</strong>. They are:</p>

        <div class="definition-box">
          <p>A probability-based language model<br />— in plain terms, a "word prediction master + super database."</p>
          <p class="note">Every word AI generates is essentially a probability guess — this is determined by the underlying Transformer architecture. Don't worry if you don't understand this part.</p>
        </div>

        <p>AI is really only good at two things:</p>

        <div class="two-things">
          <div class="thing-card">
            <h4>First, Generation.</h4>
            <p>Creating something from scratch: emails, copy, proposals, code, summaries.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="thing-card">
            <h4>Second, Summarization.</h4>
            <p>Condensing long content you don't have time to read into something digestible in minutes.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>So think of it as:</p>

        <div class="intern-box">
          <p>A "Super Intern" who has read all of the internet's content.<br />Fast, never complains, available 24/7.<br />But occasionally bullshits with complete confidence.</p>
        </div>

        <p>It needs clear instructions (Prompts) from you,<br />and it needs you to review its work.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>2. Stop Just Reading — Try It Right Now</h2>

        <p>No amount of explanation beats actually trying it.<br /><strong>AI is something you must use hands-on to truly "get it."</strong></p>

        <p>Right now, stop for 1 minute and grab your phone.</p>

        <div class="step-guide">
          <div class="step-card">
            <div class="step-number">Step 1</div>
            <div class="step-content">
              <p>Open any AI tool on your phone:<br /><strong>ChatGPT / Gemini / Claude / Copilot</strong> — any of them works.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="step-card">
            <div class="step-number">Step 2</div>
            <div class="step-content">
              <p>Don't think, just <strong>copy this exact prompt</strong> and send it:</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <div class="prompt-header">Copy this prompt:</div>
          <div class="prompt-content">
            <p>"You are a workplace communication expert with high emotional intelligence.<br />I just received a project request, but my hands are already full, and this request isn't part of my core KPIs. I need to politely decline my colleague.</p>
            <p>Please help me write a response that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Is polite but firm in tone</li>
              <li>Doesn't say "no" directly, but mentions specific scheduling difficulties</li>
              <li>Offers an alternative (like discussing next week, or recommending someone else)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please generate <strong>2 different versions</strong> for me to choose from."</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="step-guide">

            <div class="step-content">
              <p>Hit enter.<br /><strong>Wait 10 seconds.</strong></p>
              <p>Read the response carefully.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Now let me ask you something real:</p>

        <blockquote>
          Isn't this more professional, calm, and "experienced"<br />than what you'd come up with after struggling for 30 minutes?
        </blockquote>

        <p>If you're nodding, congratulations —<br />you've completed <strong>Lesson 1 of Using AI</strong>.</p>

        <p>This is called:</p>

        <div class="principle-highlight">
          <strong>When in doubt, ask AI.</strong>
        </div>

        <p>It's not being lazy.<br />It's handing the "mentally draining first draft" to AI,<br />and keeping the "valuable judgment call" for yourself.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>3. The Key Isn't the Tool — It's Changing Your Mental Habits</h2>

        <p>Many people think AI is useless. The problem isn't AI —<br />it's that they're <strong>still using search engine era habits</strong>.</p>

        <div class="comparison-grid">
          <div class="comparison-card old">
            <h4>Old Habit (Search Logic)</h4>
            <p>Search → Read → Organize → Think → Create<br />(easy to get stuck or give up)</p>
          </div>
          <div class="comparison-card new">
            <h4>New Habit (AI Logic)</h4>
            <p><strong>Prompt → AI gives draft → Human edits → Final version</strong></p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>I have a simple but extremely useful mantra:</p>

        <div class="principle-highlight">
          <strong>When in doubt, ask AI.</strong>
        </div>

        <h3>An Important Counter-Intuitive Point</h3>

        <p>Many beginners have this mental block:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "If I just ask AI right away, doesn't that mean I'm not thinking?"
        </blockquote>

        <p>It's actually the opposite.</p>

        <p><strong>The real change isn't "I stopped thinking."</strong><br /><strong>It's that I changed the order of thinking.</strong></p>

        <div class="comparison-grid">
          <div class="comparison-card old">
            <h4>Before:</h4>
            <p>Think for a long time, not sure if you're right</p>
          </div>
          <div class="comparison-card new">
            <h4>Now:</h4>
            <p>See AI's answer, immediately know what's wrong</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>You're not giving up thinking.<br />You're upgrading from "empty speculation" to "judgment."</p>

        <p>This is the future.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>One More Thing...</h2>

        <p>AI isn't learned — it's used. No "AI course" or "AI tool guide" can universally solve your AI usage. AI is a tool — just use it. Once you use it, you'll know what problems exist and how to fix them. Learn by doing.</p>

        <p>Of course, you'll encounter AI making mistakes. Here's how I see it:</p>

        <h3>Believe in AI, But Don't Trust It Blindly</h3>

        <p><strong>I believe in its capability</strong> (it has read ten thousand times more than me), <strong>but I never blindly trust its output</strong> (it occasionally bullshits with complete confidence).</p>

        <p>Once you accept this, your relationship changes: <strong>It's not your "teacher" — it's your "super intern" or "co-pilot."</strong> Since you're managing an intern, when they do poorly, it's often because we didn't guide them well.</p>

        <p>AI's capability is definitely there. Its brain has far more than mine. My job is to extract what I want. If the output isn't what I want, I think about three things:</p>

        <div class="three-aspects">
          <div class="aspect-card">
            <div class="aspect-number">1</div>
            <div class="aspect-content">Is my Prompt accurate?</div>
          </div>
          <div class="aspect-card">
            <div class="aspect-number">2</div>
            <div class="aspect-content">Is my Context sufficient?</div>
          </div>
          <div class="aspect-card">
            <div class="aspect-number">3</div>
            <div class="aspect-content">Is my Task broken down enough?</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>These three points (Prompt accuracy, Context sufficiency, Task granularity) aren't just techniques — they're <strong>"engineering thinking"</strong> applied practically. This is the divide between casual users and power users. Casual users see AI bullshitting and think "this thing sucks." Power users think "maybe I didn't ask well."</p>

        <p>Let me give you concrete examples:</p>

        <p>If AI gives you garbage, don't close the window yet. In my experience, 90% of failures come from us. Whenever I think AI is "dumb," I immediately check these three things:</p>

        <div class="check-section">
          <div class="check-card">
            <h4>Question 1: Is the Prompt written correctly?</h4>
            <p>Are you using the same "vague language" you'd use with people?</p>
            <div class="example wrong">
              <span class="label">Wrong</span>
              <p>"Help me write some copy." (Too vague, AI can only guess)<br />(Imagine if your boss said this to you — what would you do?)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example right">
              <span class="label">Right</span>
              <p>"You are an experienced social media blogger. Help me write a product recommendation post for a whitening serum. Tone should be lively, targeting working women who stay up late, highlighting 'removes dullness' as the selling point."</p>
            </div>
            <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Give a role, give a goal, give a tone.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="check-card">
            <h4>Question 2: Is the Context sufficient?</h4>
            <p>AI can't read minds. It doesn't know your "assumed context."</p>
            <div class="example wrong">
              <span class="label">Wrong</span>
              <p>"Optimize this code/text."<br />(Imagine receiving this task as a human — how would you optimize it?)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example right">
              <span class="label">Right</span>
              <p>"Here's my project background (attached doc), I'm developing with Vue.js, and I got this error (attached error log). Based on this information, help me optimize this code."</p>
            </div>
            <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Feed it as much background information from your brain as possible. <strong>Often AI seems dumb because it's in an "information vacuum."</strong></p>
          </div>

          <div class="check-card">
            <h4>Question 3: Is the Task broken down enough?</h4>
            <p>You can't eat an elephant in one bite, and neither can AI. If you throw it a super complex task, it will likely miss things here and there due to "scattered attention."</p>
            <div class="example wrong">
              <span class="label">Wrong</span>
              <p>"Help me make an app like TikTok." (This will crash AI)<br />(You'd just call your boss crazy if you got this order. AI will just produce garbage.)</p>
            </div>
